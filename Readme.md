# 🧠 AI in Software Engineering – Week 4 Project
## Overview

This project explores the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools in software engineering workflows. Through a series of practical tasks, we examine how AI enhances productivity, testing, and decision-making while maintaining fairness and ethical standards.

# 📘 Task 1: AI-Powered Code Completion

Tool Used: GitHub Copilot / Tabnine

* Implemented a Python function to sort a list of dictionaries by a key.

* Compared AI-generated code with a manual implementation.

* Finding: The AI-generated version was more concise and optimized due to efficient use of Python’s built-in functions (sorted and lambda).

# 🧪 Task 2: Automated Testing with AI

Framework: Selenium IDE with AI Plugins

* Automated test cases for a login page using valid and invalid credentials.

* Captured and analyzed results (mock screenshot included).

* Insight: AI-based tools improved test coverage and reduced repetitive manual test design.

# 📊 Task 3: Predictive Analytics for Resource Allocation

Dataset: Kaggle Breast Cancer Dataset

* Preprocessed, trained, and evaluated a Random Forest model.

* Evaluated model using Accuracy and F1-score.

* Deliverable: Jupyter Notebook (Task3_Predictive_Analytics.ipynb) showing complete workflow and performance metrics.

# ⚖️ Part 3: Ethical Reflection

* Discussed potential dataset biases (e.g., underrepresented groups).

* Suggested use of IBM AI Fairness 360 to detect and mitigate bias.

* Emphasized fairness, transparency, and responsible AI deployment.

# 💡 Bonus Task: Innovation Challenge

Proposal: AutoDocSense – Intelligent Code Documentation Assistant

* AI tool that automatically generates and updates code documentation.

* Enhances efficiency, collaboration, and documentation consistency.

* Integrated seamlessly into IDEs and CI/CD workflows.
